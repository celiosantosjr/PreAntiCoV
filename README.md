* `classify.py`: Make classification for different functional peptides set.
* `ArgsClassify.py`: Parameters of how to perform classification. 

## Requirements

We have already integrate the environment in `env.py`. execute `conda create -f env.yml` to install packages required in a new created `AMPrediction` conda env.
